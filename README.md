**Goal:** The goal of the assignment is to practice some of the tools and best practices you have learnt last week and this week.

**Task:** Your task is to select a dataset from [here](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/?keywords_en=COVID-19) and conduct exploratory data analysis using Jupyter Notebooks. Document your code in comments and in markdown. Make sure your environment is replicable using virtual environments and a requirements file. Make sure your code is kept in version control and commited to a public repository that can be shared, and that you have multiple commits to show progress over time.

**Dataset:** I chose the first one, "Ontario COVID-19 testing percent positive by age group".

**Dataset URL:** [https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/ontario-covid-19-testing-percent-positive-by-age-group/resource/05214a0d-d8d9-4ea4-8d2a-f6e3833ba471](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/ontario-covid-19-testing-percent-positive-by-age-group/resource/05214a0d-d8d9-4ea4-8d2a-f6e3833ba471)
